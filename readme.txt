Hardcoded games:
- Images.py - loads and assigns images

Dynamically coded games:
- DynamicGame.py - dynamic code editing game

- ModifiedTextGame - modified file created by TextInput.py
- BaseGame.py - default Pong test game

How to use:
- in DynamicGame.py and TextInput.py, to make a change to a variable, make sure
the name of the variable is in all caps. Then type that same all caps variable 
and the value you wish to replace the existing int with.
- in TextInput.py, to create a new game type in the word 'create' into the text box.
